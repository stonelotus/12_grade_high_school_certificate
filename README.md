RAW INFORMATICS WORK CERTIFICATE - No Visuals

Here's the Raw version of my Informatics Work Certificate, with no visual effects or edits. 
The project consists of 3 games, a media player and an "About" section.

##Game 1: 
  Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
  - Left bar is the speed, lower sets the speed faster
  - "STEP" button takes you only one generation further
  - "PLAY" button plays the generations by the set speed
##Game 2:
  Memory Game
  - The player has a couple of seconds to remember the original positions of a set of cards, then match them
##Game 3:
  X and 0 - classic game
###Media player
  Has some basic songs. Works like a classical media player, with volume bar. All based on Windows Media Player.
